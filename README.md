## Overview
This is my second Solo Project from Scrimba! The task was to get familiar with the the "OnClick" button excecution method. The Unit converter is intented to convert any number into Lenght, Mass, and Volume from Imperial to the Metric system. I'm sure my apprach wasn't the best but after a week I was able to make it work and improve on it.

### My JS Jurney

- I learn to keep the button "OnClick" actions in the JS side.
- I discovered that converting a string to a number data type can be difficult
- I got familiar with the .value properties.
- Replacing the lenghty list of variables and math operations with Loop is a great feeling. 
- I realize that cleaner code is much better.
